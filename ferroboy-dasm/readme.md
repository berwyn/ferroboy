# `ferroboy-dasm`
A disassembler for Ferroboy ROMs

## Purpose
Emulating systems is a large and complicated task. The idea behind writing a disassembler is to, given a test ROM, ensure that all the opcodes in the ROM are correctly mapped and handled. A major feature to be decided is how unofficial ROMs, like fan hacks, test ROMs, demoscenes, etc should be handled. All official ROMs using licensed memory mappers should eventually be supported by this disassembler.
